The read function enables agents to read local files on the machine.

You must use this function if a user asks you do something involving reading a named file.

The syntax for a read command is: {"cmd": "read", "args": ["FILE_NAME_HERE"]}

The syntax for returned data is {"return": "FILE_CONTENT_HERE"}
